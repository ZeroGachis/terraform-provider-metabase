# metabase Provider

The Metabase provider allows managing both metadata (collections, permissions groups) and actual visualizations (cards/questions and dashboards).

While most Terraform resources fully define the Metabase objects using attributes, the most complex ones (cards and dashboards) must be defined using JSON (and possibly templates).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "metabase" {
  endpoint = "http://metabase-endpoint.com/api"

  # Authentication can be done using a username and password...
  username = "email@address.com"
  password = "password"

  # ...or using an API key.
  # api_key = "API key"
}
```
