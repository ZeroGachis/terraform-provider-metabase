# metabase Provider

The Metabase provider allows managing both metadata (collections, permissions groups) and actual visualizations (cards/questions and dashboards).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "metabase" {
  endpoint = "http://metabase-endpoint.com/api"
  username = "email@address.com"
  password = "password"
}
```
