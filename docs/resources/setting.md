# metabase_setting (Resource)

A Metabase instance setting. This resource manages individual settings for a Metabase instance.

When this resource is destroyed, the setting will be reset to its default value. This ensures that removing the resource from Terraform configuration doesn't leave the setting in an unknown state.

~> **Note:** Some Metabase settings require the Enterprise Edition to be configured. Attempting to set these settings on a Community Edition instance will result in an error. Please refer to the [Metabase documentation](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/configuring-metabase/settings) for details about which settings require Enterprise Edition.
