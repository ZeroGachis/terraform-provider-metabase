# metabase_dashboard (Resource)

A Metabase dashboard.

Although a dashboard object is even more complex than a card (question), basic properties are exposed as Terraform attributes. The more complex ones, parameters and cards, are exposed a raw JSON strings. Similarly to cards, templatefile and jsonencode can be used to make the definition more readable.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "metabase_table" "table" {
  name = "my_table"
}

resource "metabase_card" "some_great_insights" {
  json = jsonencode({
    name                = "üí° Some great insights"
    description         = "üìñ You will learn a lot from this graph!"
    collection_id       = null
    collection_position = null
    cache_ttl           = null
    query_type          = "query"
    dataset_query = {
      database = data.metabase_table.table.db_id
      query = {
        source-table = data.metabase_table.table.id
        aggregation = [
          ["count"]
        ]
        breakout = [
          ["field", data.metabase_table.table.fields["group_by_column"], null]
        ]
      }
      type = "query"
    }
    parameter_mappings     = []

      default   = "past30days"
    },
  ])

          parameter_id = "83e68ca2",
          card_id      = metabase_card.some_great_insights.id,
          target = [
            "dimension",
            ["field", data.metabase_table.table.fields["filter_date_column"], null]
          ]

          visualization_settings = {}
          dataset_query          = {}
          archived               = false
        },
        text                  = "# ‚ùóÔ∏è Some catchy title\n\nIsn't this great?"
        "dashcard.background" = false
